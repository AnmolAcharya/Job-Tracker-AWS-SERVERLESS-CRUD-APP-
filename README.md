What problem does it solve:

This project simplifies job application tracking by offering a centralized, serverless AWS-powered portal to log, update, and manage application statuses efficiently.

Service Overview:

Cognito â€“ Handles user sign-up/login with JWT-based auth
API Gateway â€“ Connects frontend to backend APIs
Lambda â€“ Runs CRUD logic
DynamoDB â€“ Stores job data in a NoSQL table
CloudFront â€“ Delivers frontend globally with low latency
S3 â€“ Hosts frontend static files 

Currently deployed in CLoudfront:
The app is hosted using CloudFront. Owner can access it at:
ðŸ”— https://d3stgb1bbo1aaq.cloudfront.net

Access:
Once the app loads, sign up or log in using your email (handled by Cognito).
After login, the portal displays your job applications.
Use the interface to:
Add a new job entry
Edit/update an application
Delete entries if needed

All operations are secured and user-scoped using Cognitoâ€™s JWT tokens and verified by API Gateway.

#Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by a real-world problem faced during internship application cycles. The architecture and flow were refined from AWS best practices and enhanced beyond common tutorials for production-readiness.
